Course Project
------------------------------------
The run_analysis.R script in this repository takes the data provided by UCI
for Human Activity Recognition and assembles a tidy dataset. The data in
question records a number of 3-dimensional movements by 30 volunteers while
performing a certain set of activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking
downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying).

The run_analysis.R script extracts only the mean and standard deviation for 
each recorded feature, and creates a tidy dataset of the average mean and 
standard deviation for each subject/activity pairing.

The script takes four file paths as inputs for its function:
- Path containing activities and features data
- Path containing test datasets
- Path containing train datasets
- Output path of final tidy dataset
